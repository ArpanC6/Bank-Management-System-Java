# Bank Management System (Core Java & OOPS)

A **console based Bank Management System** developed using **Core Java**, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** principles.  
This project simulates basic banking operations and is designed to strengthen core Java concepts for interviews and real world understanding.


## Features
- Create bank accounts (Savings / Current)
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check account balance
- View account details
- Menu-driven console interface
- Proper validation for transactions


## OOPS Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation** – private data members with getters/setters  
- **Inheritance** – common account structure reused  
- **Polymorphism** – method overriding for account behavior  
- **Abstraction** – logical separation of banking operations  
- **Classes & Objects** – real world bank entity modeling  


## Technologies Used
- Java (Core Java)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub
